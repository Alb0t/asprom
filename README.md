Aerospike Prometheus exporter

This follows the logic from [asgraphite](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-graphite). Run a `asprom` collector against every node in the aerospike cluster.

Statistics collected:

  * aerospike_node_*: node wide statistics. e.g. memory usage, cluster state.
  * aerospike_ns_*: per namespace. e.g. objects, migrations.
  * aerospike_sets_*: statistics per set: objects, memory usage
  * aerospike_latency_*: read/write/etc latency rates(!), per namespace
  * aerospike_ops_*: read/write/etc ops per second, per namespace
